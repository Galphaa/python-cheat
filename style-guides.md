# Style guides

-   [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) for most of the language,
    and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) for docstrings.

    Official recommendations.

-   [Google Python Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html)

    Since Google is a heavy Python user, this one should be very good.

## Lint tools

-   [Pylint](https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint).

    Likely the most popular one.
