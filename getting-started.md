# Getting started

On Ubuntu 12.04 install all dependencies with:

	./install-ubuntu.sh

Next time you come to work on this repo, for each shell run:

    . .venv/bin/activate

## Instal Python

Use `virtualenv` as early as possible. It's like Ruby `rvm` for Python, and allows you to have multiple installations at once.
