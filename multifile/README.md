# Multi-file operations

1. `main.py`
1. `a.py`

Illustrates concepts which can only be demonstrated on multi python file projects, such as:

- imports
- modules
- `execfile`

All the tests are run by running `main.py`.

You must execute `main.py` from current dir because some of the examples depend on `os.getcwd`.
